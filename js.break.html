<!--
    The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.

The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. 
It was used to "jump out" of a switch() statement.
The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop:
The break and the continue statements are the only JavaScript statements that can "jump out of" a code block.
The continue statement (with or without a label reference) can only be used to skip one loop iteration.
The break statement, without a label reference, can only be used to jump out of a loop or a switch.
