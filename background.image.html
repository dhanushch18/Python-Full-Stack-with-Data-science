    The Real Madrid BBC trio could be heading into a reunion next season <br>
     after the stellar partnership that saw Los Blancos lift four <br> 
     Champions League titles in five seasons.<br>
      Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale first teamed up when <br>
      the latter moved to Santiago Bernabeu in 2013 for a then world-record transfer.<br>
       Five seasons later, the trio disbanded with Ronaldo leaving for Juventus <br>
        and Bale, now plying his trade for Tottenham on loan. However, <br> 
        Real Madrid could see a reunion of sorts if reports are to be believed.
