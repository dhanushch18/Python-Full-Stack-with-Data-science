<p> The Real Madrid BBC trio could be heading into a reunion next season <br>
    after the stellar partnership that saw Los Blancos lift four <br> 
    Champions League titles in five seasons.<br>
     Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale first teamed up when <br>
     the latter moved to Santiago Bernabeu in 2013 for a then world-record transfer.<br>
      Five seasons later, the trio disbanded with Ronaldo leaving for Juventus <br>
       and Bale, now plying his trade for Tottenham on loan. However, <br> 
       Real Madrid could see a reunion of sorts if reports are to be believed. </p>

<!--
    If the background image is smaller than the element,
     the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically,
      until it reaches the end of the element:

    To avoid the background image from repeating itself,
     set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

    If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):
