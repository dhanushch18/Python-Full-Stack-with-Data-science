<!--

The break Keyword
When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.


Switching Details
If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.

If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.

If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.
