    <h1 id="L">London</h1>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the  United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
    <h1 id="D">Delhi</h1>
    <p>Delhi, India’s capital territory, is a massive metropolitan area in the <br>
country’s north. In Old Delhi, a neighborhood dating to the 1600s, <br> 
stands the imposing Mughal-era Red Fort, a symbol of India, and the sprawling 
Jama Masjid mosque, whose courtyard accommodates 25,000 people.</p>
    <h1 id="P">Paris</h1>
    <p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art,<br>
     fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed <br>
     by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower<br> 
     and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its <br>
      cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
